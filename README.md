Intro to C++, learning to do things you can already do in Java

Reading
=======

**C++ Programming** at WikiBooks.

All of the readings are free online, though note that the book is under constant revision. If something looks crazy, ask me about it.

1. Why our code is split into .h files and .cpp files: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/File_Organization (6p)
2. What is the :: operator for? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Scope Stop at "unnamed namespace"
3. What does the compiler do? What does it NOT do? What does the pre-processor do? What does the linker do? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler Stop at "Compile speed" (4p) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor (13p) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler/Linker (4p)
4. Bitwise operators. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Bitwise_operators (2p)
5. Arrays, and the subscript operator. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Subscript_operator_.5B_.5D (5p)
6. Pointers. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#address-of_operator_.26 and https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Pointers.2C_Operator_.2A (9p) Skip the part about multi-dimensional arrays, and the part about pointers to functions.
7. Dynamic memory allocation. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Dynamic_memory_allocation (4p)

Homework
========

1. Fork this repo
2. Use `git checkout` to check out your branch of the project (which is your unique id)
3. Fill in the blanks in the main.cpp with code that produces the correct result. Read the comments to find out what they ought to do.
4. Be sure to `git commit` and `git push` often
5. Update this file with your documentation and the answers to questions.
6. When you are ready to turn in your homework, submit a pull request from your branch in your repo, to your branch in MY repo.
7. Be sure to check the pull requests for my repo on github to make sure it worked, and that your work has been submitted.

Documentation
=========

For each of the following functions in main.cpp, tell me whether or not you think it is working in your submission.

1. prime - yes
2. defix - yes
3. sumSlice - no
4. square - yes
5. listPrimes - yes

Questions
=======

#### 1. In C++, the compiler compiles each .cpp file separately, without looking at the others. Explain why this leads to the need for .h files.
This leads to the necessity of .h files because it holds commonly used statements that otherwise would be re compiled in ever file.

#### 2. Explain the individual roles of the preprocessor, the compiler, and the linker. What type of inputs do they take? What kind of outputs do they produce? What is the purpose of each?
the preprocessor works to include the header files and other things, the compiler turns the cpp files into machine readable code
and the linker mixes all of it together, filling in blanks the compiler skipped over
#### 3. What is a "pointer"?
a reference address to a portion of ram
#### 4. If I have a variable declared as `int x`, how do I find out what memory address that variable is stored at?
x*
#### 5. If I want a variable `p` that can store the address of an int, what type should I declare `p` to be?
int*
#### 6. Just like Java, C++ has a `new` command. But C++ also has a `delete` command that Java does not have. Why do we need `delete` in C++, but not in Java? What is `delete` good for?
We need it in C++ because C++ doesn't clear out the variable when it is done with. so that memory can have non zero results.
#### 7. What is one question about C++ that you would like me to explain in class?
more over the roles of pre processor compiler and linker.
