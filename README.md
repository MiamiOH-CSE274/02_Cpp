Intro to C++, learning to do things you can already do in Java

Reading
=======

**C++ Programming** at WikiBooks.

All of the readings are free online, though note that the book is under constant revision. If something looks crazy, ask me about it.

1. Why our code is split into .h files and .cpp files: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/File_Organization (6p)
2. What is the :: operator for? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Scope Stop at "unnamed namespace"
3. What does the compiler do? What does it NOT do? What does the pre-processor do? What does the linker do? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler Stop at "Compile speed" (4p) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor (13p) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Compiler/Linker (4p)
4. Bitwise operators. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Bitwise_operators (2p)
5. Arrays, and the subscript operator. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Subscript_operator_.5B_.5D (5p)
6. Pointers. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#address-of_operator_.26 and https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Pointers.2C_Operator_.2A (9p) Skip the part about multi-dimensional arrays, and the part about pointers to functions.
7. Dynamic memory allocation. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators#Dynamic_memory_allocation (4p)

Homework
========

1. Fork this repo
2. Use `git checkout` to check out your branch of the project (which is your unique id)
3. Fill in the blanks in the main.cpp with code that produces the correct result. Read the comments to find out what they ought to do.
4. Be sure to `git commit` and `git push` often
5. Update this file with your documentation and the answers to questions.
6. When you are ready to turn in your homework, submit a pull request from your branch in your repo, to your branch in MY repo.
7. Be sure to check the pull requests for my repo on github to make sure it worked, and that your work has been submitted.

Documentation
=========

For each of the following functions in main.cpp, tell me whether or not you think it is working in your submission.

1. prime - It works!
2. defix - It works!
3. sumSlice - It works!
4. square - It works!
5. listPrimes - It works!



Questions
=======

#### 1. In C++, the compiler compiles each .cpp file separately, without looking at the others. Explain why this leads to the need for .h files.

From my understaning, the header files declares "what" a class will do, while the cpp file defines "how" it will perform those features.
This reduces dependencies.

#### 2. Explain the individual roles of the preprocessor, the compiler, and the linker. What type of inputs do they take? What kind of outputs do they produce? What is the purpose of each?

The header runs over all the files and makes it into one compilable piece called Translation Unit. The compiler runs on each source file and outputs an object file. The linker takes all our object files and then links them into an executable program.

#### 3. What is a "pointer"?

Pointer is a variable that stores a memory address.

#### 4. If I have a variable declared as `int x`, how do I find out what memory address that variable is stored at?

You use the operator &.

#### 5. If I want a variable `p` that can store the address of an int, what type should I declare `p` to be?

It should be declared as an integer variable.

#### 6. Just like Java, C++ has a `new` command. But C++ also has a `delete` command that Java does not have. Why do we need `delete` in C++, but not in Java? What is `delete` good for?

Java automatically deletes variables with the garbage collector. However, in cpp memory is assigned to each variable created and therefore should be deleted after its use to save memory.

#### 7. What is one question about C++ that you would like me to explain in class?
Could you elaborate on going about using different file types?
